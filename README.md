# Prototype-supervised Adversarial Network for Targeted Attack of Deep Hashing
This is the code for [our CVPR 2021 paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Wang_Prototype-Supervised_Adversarial_Network_for_Targeted_Attack_of_Deep_Hashing_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf) "Prototype-supervised Adversarial Network for Targeted Attack of Deep Hashing", which formulates a flexible generative architecture for efficient and effective targeted hashing attack. In this repository, we not only provide the implementation of the proposed Prototype-supervised Adversarial Network (i.e., ProS-GAN), but also collect some popular deep hashing methods used in the paper and the previous targeted attack methods in hashing based retrieval.

## Usage
#### Dependencies
- Python 3.7.6
- Pytorch 1.6.0
- Numpy 1.18.5
- Pillow 7.1.2
- CUDA 10.2


#### Train hashing models
Initialize the hyper-parameters in hashing.py following the paper, and then run
```
python hashing.py
```

#### Attack by P2P or DHTA
Initialize the hyper-parameters in dhta.py following the paper, and then run
```
python dhta.py
```

#### Train ProS-GAN
Initialize the hyper-parameters in main.py following the paper, and then run
```
python main.py --train True
```

#### Evaluate ProS-GAN
Initialize the hyper-parameters in main.py following the paper, and then run
```
python main.py --train False --test True
```
